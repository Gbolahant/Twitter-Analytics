## Skills Demonstrated 
This project demonstrates proficiency in data collection, data preparation, data analysis using Power BI, data visualization, insight generation, effective communication, and utilizing data for decision-making purposes.

## Data Sourcing
Data was scrapped from twitter using Python and saved into a CSV file.

## Data Transformation
During the data preparation phase of the #30DAYSOFLEARNING Twitter hashtag analysis, several data transformations were performed to extract relevant information from the collected dataset. The following transformations were applied:

- Date Extraction: A new column was created to extract the date from the existing timestamp column. This transformation enables easier analysis and visualization based on specific dates.

- Day Name Extraction: Another new column was created to extract the day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) from the timestamp. This transformation provides insights into daily trends and patterns related to the hashtag.

- Day Name Abbreviation: To further enhance readability and visual presentation, the first three letters of the day name were extracted to create an abbreviated version (e.g., Mon, Tue). This transformation allows for concise representation of the day names in visualizations and analysis.

By performing these data transformations, the dataset now includes additional columns for date, day name. These transformations enable more granular analysis and visualization of the #30DAYSOFLEARNING hashtag data, specifically focusing on specific dates and daily patterns. These transformed columns can be utilized in Power BI to create informative charts, tables, and filters that provide insights into the temporal aspects of the campaign.
